Overview
This repository provides a Python function, inspired by lecture materials on regression analysis, to calculate the adjusted R-squared. The function, named calculate_adjusted_r_squared, takes independent variable(s) (x) and the dependent variable (y) as inputs, returning the adjusted R-squared value.

Instructions
Create Function:
Utilize the provided code to implement the calculate_adjusted_r_squared function.

Check Function:
Ensure the function's functionality by applying it to your real independent variable(s) and dependent variable data. Replace x_example and y_example with your specific data.

Exercise Solution:
Solve the exercise at the bottom of the notebook. Verify the function's correctness by running all previous cells and confirming it produces the expected adjusted R-squared value.
